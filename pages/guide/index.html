    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="section intro">
      <h2>Prepare to be changed</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered what it would feel like if you discovered a secret world behind the curtain of reality? Probably not, but psychedelics—like magic mushrooms, LSD, or even MDMA—can put you on a mind-bending journey. But before you dive in, it helps to know what to expect and how to set yourself up for a smooth, fun ride. We’ve taken the key points from Psych Central’s comprehensive article on first-time psychedelics and boiled them down into a friendly, down-to-earth facts. Think of this as your pre-trip checklist, minus the nerdy stuff and full of info.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Experience -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        Every psychedelic is its own kind of “trip”, but there are some shared similarities. You might notice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Visuals &amp; Colors:</strong> Imagine things breathing, colors pulsing, or patterns dancing across surfaces.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- Embedded video, full width of container -->
          <video
            src="../../assets/videos/visuals.mp4"
            type="video/mp4"
            autoplay
            loop
            muted
            playsinline
          ></video>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mind Expansion:</strong> You may end up feeling more intelligent, or even like a god of some sort. Thoughts can feel like liquid—one idea flows into the next; your short-term memory will be terrible. Expect a lot of “What was I doing again?”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Body Sensations:</strong> Tingling arms, a racing heart, jaw tension (clench-and-release), etc. Totally normal—just ride it out. If it bothers you, recognize that and know it isn’t permanent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Warp:</strong> A minute could feel like an hour, or an hour could feel like a minute—there won’t be much in between.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emotional Waves:</strong> You might swing from euphoria to a heavy, introspective moment. Both sides are part of the trip. Don’t focus on negative emotions or you’ll have a negative trip. Think of what makes you happy and ensure you are comfortable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember: these sensations can be wild, but they pass. Trust that your mind and setting are there to provide you peace.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Staying Safe -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Safety First</h2>
      <p>
        Before you pack your “toolkit” of pillows, playlists, and snacks, check for any red flags:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Health Conditions:</strong> If you have a history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, heart issues, or seizure disorders, take extra caution. These experiences can amplify underlying vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications &amp; Interactions:</strong> SSRIs, mood stabilizers, or other prescriptions can change how psychedelics hit your system. Chat with your doctor or therapist to see if anything clashes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Age &amp; Life Stage:</strong> Most pros recommend waiting until you’re at least 18. Your brain is still sculpting itself in your teens—give it time before tripping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Polydrug Use:</strong> Mixing alcohol, cannabis, or other substances can turn your trip sideways. Stick to one psychedelic at a time—“start low, go slow.”
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you’re ever feeling overwhelmed—even if it’s just dark thoughts—reach out to a trusted friend or family member. You don’t have to ride the storm alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Set & Setting -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Set &amp; Setting</h2>
      <p>
        This is a very important section to read—it can make or break a trip:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mindset:</strong> Check in with yourself. Why are you tripping? Are you curious, seeking healing, or just chasing a novel vibe? Get your headspace aligned before you ingest anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Setting:</strong> Choose a cozy, familiar place—your living room decked with fairy lights, a trusted friend’s pad, or a guided retreat center. Avoid public places or chaotic crowds for your first trip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Substance:</strong> Know what you’re taking. If it’s magic mushrooms, weigh your dosage. If it’s LSD, verify (if possible) and start with a microdose before committing to a full tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dosage:</strong> Less is more for your first time. Half the recommended dose can still unlock the door without smashing it down. You can’t get off the rollercoaster once it takes off.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you hit the sweet spot, let go of expectations. Embrace whatever comes—good or tough. That’s where the real fun is: self-exploration.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Working with Pros -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Buddy Up or Go Pro</h2>
      <p>
        Solo trips can work, but having a <em>trip sitter</em>—someone sober who’s done their homework—can give you the best and safest trip possible. For an extra layer of guidance, look into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Retreats &amp; Ceremonies:</strong> Organizations like MAPS, Fluence, or Psychedelic Passage often host structured, professionally guided sessions. They handle dosing, integration circles, and aftercare so you can focus on the journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hotlines &amp; Helplines:</strong> If you need immediate support—during a challenging set—Fireside Project’s hotline is there to walk you through tough patches.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Working with qualified facilitators can transform a “wild ride” into a much calmer journey.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Trusting the Process -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Trust the Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Psychedelics often poke at your buried feelings, your shadow self, or long-forgotten memories. When things get intense:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Don’t Panic:</strong> If the visuals spike or your mind goes into overdrive, take a few deep breaths. Remind yourself, “Everything I am feeling is temporary.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Let Go:</strong> You can either grip the experience and battle it—or loosen your grip and let the wave carry you. Surrender can feel scary, but it’s where the magic happens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay Present:</strong> Focus on your breath, your heartbeat, or a comforting playlist. Ground yourself with simple anchors—like cozy socks or a warm drink.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Are You a Good Candidate? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Is This Trip for You?</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s the lowdown on who’s primed for a first psychedelic voyage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You’re ready to face your fears—no hiding from whatever bubbles up.</li>
        <li>You’re open-minded, curious, and willing to let go of expectations.</li>
        <li>You’ve read up on risks, talked to your doc or a trusted friend, and feel grounded.</li>
        <li>You’re committed to integrating the experience—meaning you’ll journal, meditate, or chat about what you learned afterward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you checked off most of these, congrats—you might just be a good fit. If not, take your time. There’s no rush to pop that first tab.
      </p>

      <h2>Ready to Embark?</h2>
      <p>
